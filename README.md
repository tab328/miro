My attempt at updating, streamlining, and customizing this media player since it's the only one I found that had a popout video player with seperate music-player-style controls. (A music video player is all I wanted. Is that so hard?)

  The centerpiece of the Miro platform, Miro is a desktop application
  that aims to make Internet TV an enjoyable experience for even the
  least technically sophisticated user.  Miro can view channels
  created with Broadcast Machine as well as a wide variety of other
  video sources on the Internet.  It also integrates with the remaining
  two components of the Miro platform: Channel Guide for promoting
  channels and Video Bomb for easy end-user republishing and social
  promotion of individual videos.
